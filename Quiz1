Your company has 10 million (10,000,000) data records to process. At the moment, the algorithm being used takes almost an hour (~56 minutes) to process the 10 million records on a computer that can perform 30 billion (30,000,000,000) instructions per second. The algorithm being used requires n^2 instructions to process n data records.

The length of time to process the data records is calculated with the following formula:
total number of instructions ref/ number of instructions per sec = number of seconds required:


For instance, to calculate the length of time it takes the current computer with the current algorithm, the formula was used like this:



There are two options available:

1. Implement a new algorithm that requires n instructions to process n data records, or

2. Buy a new computer that is 10 times as fast as the current computer and can perform 300 billion (300,000,000,000) instructions per second.

Complete the following questions.

Question 1
Which of these two options will result in faster processing time?
Responses

Implement the new algorithm that requires n instructions to process n records.
Implement the new algorithm that requires n instructions to process n records. - correct

Buy a new computer that is 10 times as fast.
Buy a new computer that is 10 times as fast. - no response given

Question 2
If the company decided to buy a computer that was 10 times as fast as the current computer, how long will it take to process the 10 million records?
Responses

 
A. Less than a second  
B About one minute
C About 6 minutes - correct
D About 30 minutes 

Question 3
If the company decided to implement the new algorithm and keep the same computer, how long will it take to process 10 million records?
 
A. Less than a second - correct
B About one minute
C About 6 minutes
D.About 30 minutes

 
Question 4
The company has since grown and now has 20 million (20,000,000) records to process.

If the original algorithm that takes n^2 instructions to process n records was used on the original computer that performs 30 billion (30,000,000,000) instructions per second, how long will it take to process the data now?

Responses

Twice as long - about 2 hours
